# Temporary Email Service

## Overview

This project is a temporary email service application providing disposable email addresses. It enables instant email creation, message viewing, and content reading without registration, prioritizing privacy and a simple user experience. The application's design adheres to Apple HIG principles, focusing on accessibility, animations, smooth interactions, and a Gen-Z friendly aesthetic. The business vision is to offer a reliable, user-friendly disposable email solution with a premium feel, aiming for broad market adoption due to its privacy features and intuitive design.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
Preferred features: Email sharing, animations, mobile-first design, Gen-Z friendly UI.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture

The frontend is built with React and TypeScript, utilizing Vite for development. It leverages `shadcn/ui` (Radix UI and Tailwind CSS) for its component system, following a "new-york" style with CSS variables for theming. TanStack Query manages server state, and Wouter handles client-side routing. The design is inspired by Apple HIG, emphasizing clear hierarchy, immediate functionality, generous spacing, readable content widths (`max-w-4xl`), and typography (Inter for UI, JetBrains Mono for emails). It features smooth animations (animated gradients, confetti, fade-in-up, pulse) and a mobile-first, Gen-Z friendly aesthetic with vibrant colors. Key components include `EmailGenerator`, `InboxList`, `EmailDetailModal`, and a responsive `Header`. The application implements aggressive bundle optimization through code splitting, tree-shaking, and CSS code splitting for lightning-fast performance and efficient caching. It also includes comprehensive caching strategies using `localStorage` with TTL, request deduplication, and a service worker for offline support and stale-while-revalidate caching. Premium domain indicators (golden crown icons) are integrated for select domains. The QR Code Modal has been redesigned for better scanning, visual appeal, and social sharing options.

### Backend Architecture

The backend uses Express.js with Node.js and TypeScript, serving as a RESTful API proxy to an external temp mail service (`api.barid.site`). It offers endpoints for fetching domains, inbox contents, and email details. Custom middleware handles logging, JSON parsing, error handling, and Zod schema validation. The server integrates with Vite for HMR in development and serves static assets in production. Security hardening includes attack detection (SQL injection, XSS), progressive IP blocking, rate limiting, and enhanced security headers (HSTS, CSP, X-Frame-Options, CORS hardening).

### Data Models

Data validation is performed using Zod schemas for `EmailSummary`, `Email`, and `Domain` objects. The application operates without a persistent database, fetching all email-related data on-demand from the external API.

## External Dependencies

### Third-Party API

The core functionality relies entirely on the external temp mail API located at `https://api.barid.site` for:
- Retrieving available email domains.
- Fetching inbox contents for temporary email addresses.
- Getting detailed content of individual email messages.

### Key Libraries

- **axios**: HTTP client for API requests.
- **date-fns**: For date and time manipulation.
- **Radix UI**: Headless UI components for accessibility.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework.
- **TanStack Query**: Asynchronous state management with caching and auto-refresh (15-second interval for inbox).
- **Zod**: Schema validation.
- **lucide-react**: Icon library.
- **recharts**: Charting library (though not explicitly used in current feature descriptions, it's mentioned as a vendor chunk).

### Development Tools

- **TypeScript**: Ensures end-to-end type safety.
- **Vite**: Frontend build tool and development server.
- **esbuild**: Bundles backend server code.
- **Drizzle ORM**: Configured for PostgreSQL but not currently utilized.
